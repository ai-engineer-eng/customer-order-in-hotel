# customer-order-in-hotel
In this program, a customer visits a hotel, and the waiter asks for their order. The customer requests the menu, which the waiter provides. After 5 seconds, the waiter asks for the order again. If the customer selects an item from the list, a 'Thank You' message appears; otherwise, a 'Sorry, we don't have that' message is shown.
